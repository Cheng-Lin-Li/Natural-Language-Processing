# Natural-Language-Processing (NLP)
Implementations of Natural Language Processing algorithm by Python 3

The repository provides demo programs for implementations of basic NLP algorithms by Python 3. I hope these programs will help people understand the NLP theories and implementations.

I will enrich those implementations and descriptions from time to time. If you include any of my work into your website or project; please add a link to this repository and send me an email to let me know.

Your comments are welcome.
Thanks,

|[POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging by Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Viterbi and smoothing method](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/HMM)|HMM is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (i.e. hidden) states. The Viterbi algorithmis used to compute the most probable path (as well as its probability) of state changing. It requires knowledge of the parameters of the HMM model and a particular output sequence and it finds the state sequence that is most likely to have generated that output sequence. It works by finding a maximum over all possible state sequences. In sequence analysis, this method can be used for example to predict coding vs non-coding sequences. This implementation include two programs: Training program with add one smoothing on initial and transition probabilities table, and emission probabilities table with no smoothing.
